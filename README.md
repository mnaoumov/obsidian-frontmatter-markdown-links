# Frontmatter Markdown Links

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that adds support for markdown links in frontmatter.

```yaml
---
# Obsidian supports natively
wikilink: "[[Note]]"
wikilinkWithAlias: "[[Note|Alias]]"
externalUrl: "https://example.com"

# Provided by this plugin
markdownLink: "[Note](Note.md)"
markdownLinkWithSpace: "[Note with space](Note%20with%20space.md)"
markdownLinkWithAngleBrackets: "[Note with space](<Note with space.md>)"
externalUrlWithAlias: "[Alias](https://example.com)"
externalUrlWithAngleBrackets: "<https://example.com>"
---
```

Also the backlinks are now working for the markdown links in frontmatter.
